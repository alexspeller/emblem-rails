# Emblem::Rails

Integrate [Emblem.js](https://github.com/machty/emblem.js) with ember-rails

## Installation

Add `gem 'emblem-rails'` to your application's Gemfile after `ember-rails`:

    gem 'ember-rails', github: "emberjs/ember-rails"
    gem 'emblem-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Note that emblem-rails is presently only compatible with `ember-rails`
master.
